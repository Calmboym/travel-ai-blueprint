# AI Travel Platform

# System Architecture Document (ARCHITECTURE.md)

Version: 1.0

Status: Draft

Document Type: Technical Architecture Specification

# 1. Architecture Overview

## Purpose

This document defines the technical architecture of the AI Travel Platform MVP.

The architecture must support:

- AI-powered travel assistance
- Multi-agent workflows
- Real-time external data retrieval
- Personalized recommendations
- Multi-language support
- Future booking capabilities
- Future Telegram Bot integration
- Future Mobile Application

The system must be modular, scalable, secure, and provider-independent.

---

# 2. Core Architecture Principles

The platform follows these principles:

## Modular Architecture

Each major capability must exist as an independent module.

---

## API First

All functionality must be accessible through APIs.

The frontend must never directly access internal services.

---

## AI Provider Independence

The system must not be locked to one AI provider.

Supported future providers:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Local AI models

---

## External Provider Independence

External services must be accessed through abstraction layers.

Example:

Hotel Service

↓

Booking Adapter

↓

Expedia Adapter

↓

Hotelbeds Adapter

---

## Security First

Security must be implemented from the beginning.

Required:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- API protection
- Secret management
